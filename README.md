# MVP-Blog
Minimum Viable Product Blog, for testing RDBMS, back-end and front-end languages, and web frameworks.

Directory structure:

MVPs directory will contain name combinations in the form $BACKEND-$RDBMS-$FRONTEND separated as shown by hypphens.  Each major component must have one or more descriptive terms for the technology used in that component, where multiple items are separated by an underscore.

For example, Perl with Mojolicious, MySQL and modern Javasscipt would be defined as Perl_Mojolicious-MySQL-ES6, and Python with Django, SQLite and React with Redux would be defined as Python_Django-SQLite-React_Redux.
